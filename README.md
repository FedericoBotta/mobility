# Instructions

The tutorial for this will use the Python programming language. If you have never worked with Python before, there's a number of resources available online to learn its syntax and functionalities. Here you can find an informative cheat sheet with an introduction to some of the basic syntax and most useful introductory features of Python:

For this specific tutorial, we will use a tool called Jupyter Notebook, which is a common data science tool for doing analysis and presenting the results in one place! Jupyter notebooks allow you to write and run code, create plots, and write up any text all in the same document. It can be extremely powerful and a great tool to become familiar with. For a detailed introduction to Jupyter Notebook, you can have a look here:

Jupyter notebooks are divided in cells, which are containers of either text to display or code to run.

When you open the notebook for this tutorial, you will see that some cells already contain text, and some others contain code.

For instance, a text cell looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 4px solid black;">
<img width="895" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 16 08 35" src="https://github.com/FedericoBotta/mobility/assets/29568541/c4a90242-a9a2-4e4e-88c7-6c36aa827bbc">
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

And a code cell looks like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 4px solid black;">
<img width="983" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 16 08 55" src="https://github.com/FedericoBotta/mobility/assets/29568541/2ee55e3e-2a9a-4af9-b686-0c56c43cc033">
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

You can run the code in a 'code cell' by clicking on that cell, and then pressing Ctrl+Enter (or âŒ˜+Enter on an Apple device). The code may take a little while to run, so it may look like nothing is happening. When the code in one cell is running, the cell number next to the cell will display an asterisk (*), as you can see here:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="border: 4px solid black;">
      <img width="1399" alt="Screenshot 2024-05-30 at 16 36 31" src="https://github.com/FedericoBotta/mobility/assets/29568541/0273791e-442e-41a3-b94f-9fc592fe0398">
  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

So that you can tell if the code is still running; once the code has finished, the asterisk will turn into a number (which represents the order in which cells have been run).

Finally, you can get started with this tutorial by pressing the 'Binder' button below. This will open a new page (note, this may take a while to load) which will contain the Jupyter notebook for this tutorial. You can use this notebook as if it was your own: you can edit the code (or anything else), run different cells, and generally play with the notebook without anyone else seeing what you are doing (if you are interested in how this was done, you can read more about Binder here https://mybinder.org).

Now go ahead and have fun!
