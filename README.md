For this specific tutorial, we will use a tool called Jupyter Notebook, which is a common data science tool for doing analysis and presenting the results in one place! Jupyter notebooks allow you to write and run code, create plots, and write up any text all in the same document. It can be extremely powerful and a great tool to become familiar with. For a detailed introduction to Jupyter Notebook, you can have a look here:
